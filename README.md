## About the project:
The main objective of this project is to provide an online platform for connecting farmers and customers where customers can purchase goods from farmers.

## Description:
In the project application, a farmer has to sign up using the application so that he/she can log in and try updating the product and can sell them. Then he/she needs to log in to the application to add/update the product details. Moreover, a farmer must be able to update his/her profile so that customers can get updated details
Next farmer must see all the orders that the customers placed soon after he/she log in so that he/she can accept or reject the orders. Furthermore, a farmer must be able to see all the products that he/she has added to update the quantity or the price if required. On top of that, a farmer must be able to add product details along with the deliverable locations such as pin codes so that the customers can place orders.
Similarly, a customer has to register in the application so that he/she can log in and check for products. Then he/she needs to log in to the application using the registered details so that they can search and buy the products needed.
Next customer has to search for products he/she needs so that they can place orders. Then they must be able to see the details of the product like price, expected delivery date, the farming methods etc so that I can order them. Having said that, they should be able to add the items to the cart so that they can order them. Furthermore, customers must be able to update the address/location details at the time of placing an order so that the delivery person stays informed.

## Problem facing till now:
We had a little problem with the implementation of CSS but we completed the CSS by applying bootstrap.
We faced a few problems related to posting and fetching data to and from the database, but we could solve the issues by going through various online resources.
Fetching the product details from the database was a little difficult but, we were able to complete data fetching successfully
We faced a little problem while trying to add image to database and we had to go through a lot of resources to solve the issue
Deciding on the right CSS styling took a lot of time and it can always be improved





## Technologies that we are learning:

* Frontend: React
* Backend: Node, Express and MongoDB

## Testing tool:
* Jest
* Code Versioning Systems:
* Git and GitHub

## Sprint 1: Learnings
* During Sprint 1, we learnt about scrum processes and agile methodology. Also, we came to know about the technologies (MERN - MongoDB, Express, React JS and Node JS) that have to be used to complete the project. 
* After that, we learnt how to create and use Git repositories and branches. During the last day of the Sprint, we started to create a database and created a sample database to know about how databases work.

## Sprint 2: Learnings
* During Sprint 2, we were split into two teams and my team was given the task of login user using Google authentication. 
* We worked for 2 days for Google authentication and then we have split again into two teams. 
* One team worked on the general login process and the other worked on the google ones. I was in charge of google authentication. 
* The difficulty I faced is in our designing part we were asked to retrieve data from a radio which separates the user from google generated information which made us difficult task.

## Sprint 3: Learnings
* During Sprint 3, my team started working on the farmer’s login and log out page where a user with type farmer can register their credentials and login to their respective pages.
* The login needs to be done with JWT authentication where a token is developed using an algorithm. 
* We generated the page but not able to redirect the user

## Sprint 4: Learnings
* During Sprint 4, my team started working on redirecting the farmer’s page to the farmer page and then the customer to the customer page. 
* But we had bugs which are to be fixed. We also fixed bugs in that. So as of now, we were ready to redirect the page to the respective user.
* Now the process is to test every component of the frontend and backend.

## Sprint 5: Learning
* During Sprint 5, my team started working on integrating our work with other team. So in this week, we were expected to do finish testing and integrating into one file. 
* For testing, we used JEST methodogy to test each and every component. Testing process completed with all the vulnerabilitites.
* For Integrating, we pushed our files into github and started to merge files with other teams. The hardest part is to look for similar components and again merge it with our components. So it takes a lot of time to do that.
